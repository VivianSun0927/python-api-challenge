# python-api-challenge
This challenge consists of two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this challenge we will be tasked with creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API we will retrieve the weather data and create a series of scatterplots that display the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Once the scatterplots have been created, we will then separate the previous data based on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere and create separate linear regression plots based on the relationships above.

## Part 2: VacationPy
In the second part of the challenge we will be creating dataframes based off of the cities_df CSV output from WeatherPy and displaying the data via GeoViews maps with interactable markers. For this challenge we will be utilizing Geoapify API to plot two maps for display, one for displaying city names with humidity levels as well as a second map for displaying nearest hotel names within the region based on set coordinates.
